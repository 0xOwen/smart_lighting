This project implements a mobile controlled smart lighting system based on Arduino.
It consists of a hardware set up with: a microcontroller, LEDs and a bluetooth module. The microcontroller code is in the microcontroller.ino file.

There is also a mobile application that communicates with the bluetooth module on the microcontroller using bluetooth sockets and threading. The mobile application is called smartswitch.
